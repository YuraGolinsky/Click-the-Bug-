Yesterday evening I sat down and thought about what interesting thing to write, so I could play and fix some bugs.

The idea came to me by itself to make a mini-game where you catch bugs. Simple, fun and with a little nostalgia.

🕹 "Click on the bug" is a small project, put together in one evening to cheer up and get back to the roots of pure HTML, CSS and JavaScript, without unnecessary bells and whistles.

🐛 Different bugs-emojis jump on the screen: normal, golden (+5 points), bad (-3 points) and even fake ones that distract.

🎯 The game has a timer, counter and sound when clicking - everything for drive and fun.

🎨 Light animation and smooth switching of the dark theme add liveliness.

The main menu offers a choice of difficulty: Easy, Medium, Hard - everyone will find their level.

I played it myself, showed it to my friends, everyone liked it. Now I share it with you. Catch bugs, improve your reaction and just enjoy!
